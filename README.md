## Current Projects:

Over the summer, our researchers made big strides studying bias detection and agentic network effects.

### Bias Detection

[Project Repo](https://github.com/Ethical-Spectacle/bias-detection/tree/main)

- This is our founding project!!
- We improved upon the architecture proposed in recent bias detection papers, creating models for bias detection and classification in text.
- **Binary Classification:**
    - Blog Post: [BERT for Bias Detection in Text](https://huggingface.co/blog/maximuspowers/bias-detection-in-text)
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** We built a synthetic dataset and trained a model to identify generalizations, unfairness, and stereotypes. With these multi-label token classifications, we can detect nested entities (imagine grammarly for social bias).
    - **Blog Post:** [Social Bias NER with BERT](https://huggingface.co/blog/maximuspowers/bias-entity-recognition)
    - **Live Model:** [HF Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/maximuspowers/bias-detection-ner)
    - **Model Repo:** [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/maximuspowers/bias-detection-ner)
- Research paper with our experiments coming in the end of Sept.
- Build something cool with our model at our [Sept 27-29 social bias hackathon](https://ethicalspectacle.org/hackathon?id=8), or learn about it in our [workshops](https://www.meetup.com/ethical-spectacle-research/events/302141069/?eventOrigin=group_events_list)

### Agents Social Network

[Project Repo](https://github.com/Ethical-Spectacle/agents-social-network)

- We use DSPy to build a network where agents can interact, store ideas, and reshare them between 1-on-1 interactions.
- In our research paper (Nov '24) we'll demonstrate the experiments that went into ensure the network's safety, such as stress tests, toxicity guardrails, and relevance evaluations.
- Build the front-end logic to trigger agent interactions between users in our [Agents Hackathon](https://ethicalspectacle.org/hackathon?id=10), check the [project repo](https://github.com/Ethical-Spectacle/agents-social-network) for an example of what you could build.
- Lot's more info and workshops to come soon from this project!!
